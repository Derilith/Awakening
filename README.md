# Greatest-Villans
The point of the Greatest-Villians webpage is to rank the greatest villian of all time, the list is short for now, but it is set up to be expanded, as i have decided to work on it outside of code louisville.
This page contains a javaScript function which allows the visitor to siply click the button named "Muhaha" and be givin a number representing how "evil" you are. This javascript function is a simple random number generator ranging from 1-100.
I have also created this webpage to be able to collapse into a single collum for use in mobile devices such as phones and tablets.
This page contains a form that allows for the visiter to leave there email address and a moniker so that they can contribute to the page.
The page ends with a footer that states that this sight doesn't own the characters that it is ranking.
I beleive that this project reflects my current skills at coding, i have kept it relativly simple as I have a personal policy of keeping things as simple as possible.
